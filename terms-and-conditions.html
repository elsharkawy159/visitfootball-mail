    <h2>General, applicability of terms and conditions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1. These general conditions apply to all agreements that are/are entered
        into with CityTravel Group B.V. Visitfootball.com is a trade name of
        CityTravel Group B.V.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Offers</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1. All offers and quotations from Visitfootball.com, in whatever form,
        are entirely without obligation unless they contain a deadline for
        acceptance.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. The customer guarantees the accuracy and completeness of the
        requirements, specifications, and other data specified to
        Visitfootball.com by or on behalf of him on which Visitfootball.com
        bases its offer.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. In the event of an obvious mistake or slip of the pen,
        Visitfootball.com is not bound by the offer. Likewise, Visitfootball.com
        is not bound to the offer if the product or service to which the offer
        or quotation relates is no longer available in the meantime.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. A compound quotation does not oblige Visitfootball.com to carry out
        part of the order at a corresponding part of the specified price.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Agreement</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1. The agreement is concluded by the traveller's acceptance of the offer
        made by Visitfootball.com. The acceptance by the traveller usually takes
        place electronically (via the booking module on the website or via
        email) but can also take place in writing or by telephone.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. When accepting the offer, please ensure that you provide
        Visitfootball.com with your details completely and correctly.
        Visitfootball.com assumes that the information is correct! If a booking
        has to be changed afterwards due to incorrect or incomplete data, all
        costs involved will be for your account.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. After the conclusion of the agreement, you will receive a
        confirmation of the agreement in writing or electronically (by e-mail).
        You are obliged to carefully check this confirmation for any errors
        immediately upon receipt. These include travel dates, match time and
        date and personal data. If the details in the confirmation are not
        correct, you should contact Visitfootball.com by return but at the
        latest within 24 hours. Changes to the flight or the names often lead to
        additional costs even when changed within 24 hours. Visitfootball.com is
        not liable for damages or costs if it appears afterwards that the
        information is not correct. Costs associated with an adjustment of a
        booking due to incorrect or incomplete data are at your expense.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. Visitfootball.com enters into the agreement under the reservation
        that it can actually reserve the booked parts without any price increase
        of one or more parts not yet implemented on the website. In this context
        Visitfootball.com reserves the right to cancel the agreement within 48
        hours (or at least 1 working day) of receiving the agreed travel sum, in
        which case Visitfootball.com shall refund the travel sum paid within 5
        working days of payment.
      </li>
      <li>
        5. Changes in transport or other costs or charges which occur after
        booking (VAT, airport or tourist taxes and fuel surcharges) will never
        be charged to the client by Visitfootball.com. The travel sum for which
        you have booked your trip can therefore never fluctuate for these
        reasons after the booking has been made.
      </li>
      <li>
        6. Obvious (or information of which it is clear to the average traveller
        that it is an error or a mistake) errors and mistakes in the information
        provided by or on behalf of Visitfootball.com and its suppliers (whether
        or not via the website) or in the agreement shall not bind
        Visitfootball.com. Visitfootball.com accepts no liability for this.
        Visitfootball.com also reserves the right to revoke itself on apparent
        errors in offers.
      </li>
      <li>
        7. There can therefore be a travel agreement if the applicable
        conditions are met. There can therefore also be a general agreement for
        the purchase of single tickets. In case of individual tickets, no travel
        agreement is concluded.
      </li>
      <li>
        8. When offering and selling (reservations for) individual tickets,
        Visitfootball.com acts as an intermediary in the conclusion of the
        agreement between the client and the organizer.
      </li>
      <li>
        9. The natural person or legal entity, who enters into a travel
        agreement on behalf of or for the benefit of a third party, is severally
        liable for all obligations resulting from this travel agreement.
      </li>
      <li>
        10. Visitfootball.com bears no responsibility for photographs, leaflets
        and other information material, which or that have been issued by third
        parties.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Implementation of the trip</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1. Visitfootball.com is entitled to engage third parties for the
        execution of the travel agreements.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. The Client(s) is (are) obliged to comply with all instructions of
        Visitfootball.com and/or its representative to promote a proper
        execution of the trip and is (are) liable for damage caused by his
        (their) unlawful behaviour, to be judged by the standard of behaviour of
        a proper Client.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. The Client, who causes or may cause such nuisance or inconvenience,
        that a good execution of a trip is or may be (strongly) hampered, may be
        excluded by Visitfootball.com from (continuation of) the trip, if
        Visitfootball.com cannot reasonably be required to fulfil the travel
        agreement. All costs resulting from the hindrance and exclusion of the
        Client shall be borne by the Client, if and insofar as the consequences
        of hindrance or inconvenience can be attributed to him.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. The client is obliged to communicate any negligence in the execution
        of the travel agreement, which is observed by him on site, as soon as
        possible in writing or in other appropriate form to the service provider
        concerned and/or to Visitfootball.com or its representative on site.
      </li>
      <li>
        5. If the Client has not complied with one or more of the aforementioned
        obligations, or has not complied with it on time or in full,
        Visitfootball.com shall be entitled to charge the Client for any
        additional costs incurred in the execution of the trip as a result of
        the Client's failure to comply with his obligations.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Amendments</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1. Visitfootball.com will always ensure an appropriate travel schedule
        within which a visit of the match is reasonably possible.
        Visitfootball.com will therefore ensure that travel arrangements are
        tailored to the match. However, it is your own responsibility to
        actually arrive at the match on time. To avoid additional costs in the
        event of a match being changed outside the flight schedule,
        Visitfootball.com recommends that you take out the premium service
        package during booking.
      </li>
      <li>2. If you are unable to participate:</li>
      <ul style="list-style: lower-alpha; margin-left: 30px">
        <li>
          In the trip and/or attend the booked event/match due to a cause not
          attributable to yourself, for example due to a flight
          delay/cancellation, cancellation/relocation of the match, or due to a
          change in match times of which you could not have been aware in time,
          Visitfootball.com will help and assist you as much as possible in
          finding a solution. N.B. This refers to situations where the first day
          of travel has already started.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the event that a match falls outside the flight schedule due to
          match rescheduling, the customer can contact Visitfootball.com. The
          conditions that apply depend on the service package chosen by the
          customer. Their conditions can be found on our website.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        3. Visitfootball.com is authorised to change the agreement on a
        substantial point due to weighty circumstances communicated to you
        immediately. Visitfootball.com shall also be entitled to change the
        agreement due to important circumstances communicated to you
        immediately, even if you would suffer a minor disadvantage as a result.
        This includes, but is not limited to, minor adjustments to flight times.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. If a match is postponed or cancelled, the conditions of your chosen
        service package will apply. If required, we may also issue refunds in
        the case of single tickets, however, the refund you receive in this case
        will be the original ticket price set by the event organiser and not the
        sum paid by you.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Substitution</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1. If you are unable to participate in the trip, another person may be
        substituted in your place under the conditions set out in paragraph 2.
      </li>
      <ul>
        <li>2. The conditions for substitution are:</li>
        <li>
          a. the other person complies with all the conditions attached to the
          trip/competition
        </li>
        <li>
          b. The request is submitted no later than 7 calendar days before
          departure, or in good time so that the necessary actions and
          formalities can still be carried out.
        </li>
        <li>
          c. The conditions of the service providers involved in the
          implementation do not preclude this substitution.
        </li>
        <li>
          d. The terms of the fare conditions of the airline do not preclude
          this substitution.
        </li>
        <li>
          e. The organiser and service providers do not object to the transfer.
        </li>
        <li>
          f. You pay the total outstanding travel sum, the amendment fee, any
          outstanding balance due to ticket price change and any extra charges
          resulting from the substitution.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>
        2. You and the person who takes your place are jointly and severally
        liable for payment of the outstanding travel sum, the amendment fee, and
        any additional costs as a result of the substitution.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. If the substitution is not possible, then you will still be liable
        for the cancellation costs.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cancellation by the client</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1. If you cancel the trip, you will continue to owe the trip price to
        Visitfootball.com. However, if it is possible for Visitfootball.com to
        cancel the booked components with its suppliers without
        Visitfootball.com remaining liable for the price or having to incur
        costs, Visitfootball.com will refund 75% of the total travel sum. It is
        also possible in this case to have 100% of the travel sum refunded in
        the form of a credit with Visitfootball.com. From one week before
        departure, the cancellation fee is always 100%. We ask you to
        communicate a cancellation in writing (by email). We will respond within
        one working day with a cancellation confirmation and the cancellation
        fee. Of course, it is also possible to receive a statement of the
        cancellation fee first.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. The date of receipt by Visitfootball.com of the written cancellation
        is regarded as the cancellation date.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. Visitfootball.com's working days and office hours are Monday to
        Friday from 09.00 to 17.00. Email or other messages received at
        Visitfootball.com during the time Visitfootball.com's office is closed
        shall be deemed to have been received on the next working day
        thereafter.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cancellation by Visitfootball.com</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1. If the travel agreement has been concluded within 6 weeks before the
        date of departure and the client has not paid the full travel sum on the
        day of departure, Visitfootball.com has the right to cancel the trip
        with immediate effect. This without prejudice to Visitfootball.com's
        right to the full payment of the travel sum by the client.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Visitfootball.com may further cancel the travel agreement for
        important reasons or circumstances and only with immediate effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. Visitfootball.com has in particular the right to cancel the agreement
        with immediate effect up to 5 working days before the day of departure,
        if the number of principals who have registered for a particular trip is
        less than the required minimum number of principals for said trip.
        Visitfootball.com will then refund to the client the amount already paid
        as soon as possible. The Client shall not be entitled to any
        compensation.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. Due to fluctuating availability of match tickets, Visitfootball.com
        has the right to cancel a booked package up to 3 weeks prior to
        departure. The other party can then choose between a full refund or a
        switch to another match with a possible additional payment or refund.
        Visitfootball.com is not responsible for external costs incurred in
        relation to the package.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Exclusion of right of withdrawal</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1. The travel contract referred to in Article 7:500 of the Civil Code is
        excluded from the right of withdrawal. Consequently, the customer cannot
        use its right of withdrawal.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Likewise, the client's right of withdrawal is excluded on the leisure
        agreement. This therefore relates to individual tickets. The cooling-off
        period of 14 days during which the agreement can be dissolved without
        giving reasons therefore does not apply. Single tickets cannot be
        returned. The provisions of article 6:230p sub e of the Civil Code apply
        to loose tickets.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Travel sum</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1. The published travel sum applies per client, unless expressly stated
        otherwise in the relevant publication.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Price quotations of the travel sum are always made on the basis of
        the prices valid on the date of the formation of the agreement. Price
        quotations of the travel sum are also based on the fact that
        Visitfootball.com can execute the travel agreement without any
        stagnation.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. If one or more cost price factors, such as wages, social and
        governmental costs, tolls, exchange rates, fuel surcharges, insurance
        premiums and import and export duties, undergoes an increase after the
        conclusion of the agreement, even if this increase was foreseeable,
        Visitfootball.com shall be entitled to pass this increase on to the
        Client.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. Price quotations of the travel sum are always stated inclusive of any
        B(elasting) T(ole) W(earth) payable, but exclusive of any other levy.
      </li>
      <li>
        5. All our quoted prices include service, shipping and handling charges.
        Service, shipping and handling costs include all costs incurred to
        transform the customer's request into a unique football experience. The
        price stated on the ticket in some cases may therefore differ from the
        price you have paid to us.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Payment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1. After the formation of the travel agreement, the client shall pay to
        Visitfootball.com the amount charged by or on behalf of
        Visitfootball.com within the term of payment specified on the
        invoice/confirmation, whereby the value date of the credit to
        Visitfootball.com is or shall be a decisive factor.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. The client who has not timely fulfilled a financial obligation
        towards Visitfootball.com shall owe interest on the principal sum of 1%
        for each month or part of a month of delay. Furthermore, the client
        shall be obliged to pay to Visitfootball.com the extrajudicial
        collection costs associated with the collection of the debts of
        Visitfootball.com , without prejudice to Visitfootball.com's right to be
        allowed to charge further reasonable costs pursuant to article 6:96
        paragraph 2 sub c of the Civil Code. The Client shall be obliged to pay
        the extrajudicial collection costs related to the collection of the
        claims of Visitfootball.com . The extrajudicial costs to be paid by the
        Client shall then be determined on the basis of the graduated scale as
        included in the Besluit vergoeding voor buitengerechtelijke
        incassokosten.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. Non-timely payment by the Client may result in Visitfootball.com
        being unable to guarantee an agreement with immediate effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. In the event of non-timely payment, Visitfootball.com may terminate
        the agreement with immediate effect without Visitfootball.com being
        obliged to pay any financial compensation.
      </li>
      <li>
        5. By payment of (a part of) the amount due, as stated on the
        invoice/confirmation, the client agrees - apart from other provisions -
        without any exception to the provisions stated in these general
        conditions.
      </li>
    </ul>

      </li>
      <li>
        2. You are obliged to carefully check the travel documents provided by
        Visitfootball.com immediately upon receipt for any errors. If the travel
        documents are incorrect, you should contact Visitfootball.com by return.
        Visitfootball.com is not liable for any damage or costs if it appears
        afterwards that the travel documents are not correct. Costs associated
        with an adjustment of the travel documents due to incorrect or
        incomplete information will be at your expense.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. Match tickets are always for the home box, unless otherwise booked in
        advance. It is not permitted to wear club colours of the away side
        during the match.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. Visitfootball.com uses season/membercards for many matches. These
        season/member cards should be returned by the customer to the hotel
        reception after the match or returned to Visitfootball.com. Upon
        delivery of the match tickets, the customer always receives an
        instruction enclosed with what the customer should do with the match
        tickets after the match. The Client is liable for any costs and damage
        which Visitfootball.com has to incur or suffers if the Client does not
        comply with these instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        5. Visitfootball.com guarantees when booking an even number of people
        that no one will sit alone, unless otherwise stated. You may be placed
        in pairs of 2. When booking an odd number of people, we do not guarantee
        for every match that no one will sit alone. It is the customer's
        responsibility to check with Visitfootball.com before payment what the
        seating allocation is for the specific match.
      </li>
      <li>
        6. Visitfootball.com reserves the right to 'upgrade' match tickets free
        of charge to a better category, with Category 1 being better than
        Category 2, which is better than Category 3. Ranking of categories is
        visible during the booking process. In case tickets in the chosen
        category or a better category cannot be delivered Visitfootball.com
        reserves the right to deliver match tickets in a lesser category and
        refund the price difference to the client.
      </li>
      <li>
        7. You are responsible for holding the correct and valid border and
        travel documents such as a valid passport/identity card, visa and any
        health documents. You will need to obtain information about these from
        the designated authorities. Visitfootball.com is not liable for damages
        or costs if you do not have correct and valid border and travel
        documents.
      </li>
      <li>
        8. Visitfootball.com. strongly recommends that you take out travel and
        cancellation insurance. Please ask us about appropriate travel or
        cancellation insurance for your package.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Playing dates and times</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1. As a customer, you should check whether the match indeed starts on
        the date and time as indicated by Visitfootball.com . Inaccuracies in
        information provided or mentioned should be reported by the consumer to
        Visitfootball.com without delay.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Visitfootball.com cannot be held to the date given as an indication,
        it is only an indication and can therefore be changed. A client who
        enters into a travel agreement or buys a single ticket via
        Visitfootball.com cannot cancel the agreement on the grounds of changing
        playing date and/or reception time. The conditions applicable in this
        case depend on your chosen service package.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Force majeure</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1. Visitfootball.com shall not imputably fail in its obligations under
        the travel agreement, if the non, untimely or inadequate execution of
        the travel agreement is due to force majeure.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Force majeure shall mean any circumstance beyond the control of
        Visitfootball.com which is of such a nature that compliance with the
        agreement cannot reasonably be required of Visitfootball.com (so-called
        non-attributable failure to perform). Force majeure shall also include:
        illness of staff, strikes, defective machinery, lack of raw materials,
        epidemics, computer viruses, operational breakdowns, storms, fire, water
        damage, war (danger), riots, import and export impediments, road blocks,
        toll increases as well as all impediments caused by government measures
        and all impediments or negligence, (partly) caused by incomplete,
        untimely or inadequate compliance with the obligations towards
        Visitfootball. com by the third parties engaged by it, on whom
        Visitfootball.com depends in its business operations, including the
        delivery and/or delivery of admission tickets, travel documents and the
        like, regardless of the reason or cause thereof.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. If Visitfootball.com has already partially met its obligations when
        the force majeure occurs, or can only partially meet its obligations,
        Visitfootball.com shall be entitled to invoice the part already
        delivered or the deliverable part separately and the Client shall be
        obliged to pay this invoice as if it were a separate agreement. However,
        this does not apply if the part has already been delivered or the
        deliverable part has no independent value.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Liability</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1. Should Visitfootball.com be liable, then this liability shall be
        limited to what is regulated in this provision.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Visitfootball.com is not liable for damage as a result of the
        improper execution of the travel agreement if and insofar as the
        shortcomings in the execution can be attributed to one or more Client(s)
        or one or more co-Clients.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. Visitfootball.com is not liable for damage resulting from the lack of
        full coverage on the travel and/or cancellation insurance of the
        Principal.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. The liability of Visitfootball.com towards its client and third
        parties for damages resulting from or related to the execution of the
        agreement shall always be limited to the amount to which the liability
        insurance gives claim in the relevant case, increased by the amount of
        the excess of the relevant policy. In the event - for whatever reason -
        no payment should be made under the liability insurance referred to in
        article 15.4, Visitfootball.com's liability for direct damages shall be
        limited to an amount of EURO 450.00 per event or (a series of) events
        which are apparently or appear to be related to each other in such a way
        that they should be considered as one event.
      </li>
      <li>
        5. Visitfootball.com shall never be obliged to pay any damages to the
        Client and to others, unless there is intent or gross negligence on the
        part of Visitfootball.com.
      </li>
      <li>
        6. The exclusions and/or limitations of Visitfootball.com's liability
        included in this article also apply for the benefit of employees of
        Visitfootball.com , the booking office and service providers involved,
        as well as their staff, unless treaty or law excludes this.
      </li>
      <li>
        7. If the Client is otherwise entitled to compensation in the event of
        damage, the Client shall in that case recover the damage suffered from
        that insurance company, institution or otherwise and Visitfootball.com
        shall be indemnified against claims in this respect. The Client shall
        also indemnify Visitfootball.com for all costs and damage that may arise
        for Visitfootball.com from possible legal claims of third parties, such
        to the extent that the law does not prevent the relevant damage and
        costs from being for the account of the Client.
      </li>
      <li>
        8. If the Client has not paid the calculated travel sum or part thereof
        to Visitfootball.com in full and/or in a timely manner, the Client may -
        in case of damage or culpable inconvenience - not assert any right to
        (damage) compensation.
      </li>
      <li>
        9. The failure or reduction of facilities, which Visitfootball.com
        cannot influence, may not and cannot be blamed on Visitfootball.com and
        no compensation can therefore be given.
      </li>
      <li>
        10. If, for whatever reason and in whatever manner, the Client causes or
        takes risks, or at least causes situations, or at least cooperates in
        these, or at least does not prevent them, which cause or may cause
        damage, Visitfootball.com may with immediate effect exclude further
        participation in the trip or the event. In this case, no liability
        towards Visitfootball.com shall arise.
      </li>
      <li>
        11. Visitfootball.com shall not be liable for possible damage due to
        misconduct such as, but not limited to, aggression and drunkenness,
        caused by the other party. If you are refused or removed from the plane,
        hotel or stadium as a result of misconduct or not following the
        instructions of the staff, stewards or crew, this shall be at the Other
        Party's own expense. Visitfootball.com shall not issue a refund to the
        other party in these cases.
      </li>
      <li>
        12. If the Client has purchased a single ticket for a match via
        Visitfootball.com and circumstances occur which prevent the Client from
        getting into the stadium, Visitfootball.com shall not be liable for any
        damage resulting from this. These possible damages may include the
        flight to the stadium venue and hotel accommodation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        1. Visitfootball.com makes every effort to ensure that your trip runs
        smoothly. Nevertheless, problems may arise. If at any time you

        letter within a maximum of 10 working days.
      </li>
      <li>
        3. Since Visitfootball.com often depends or will depend on third
        parties, the Client will have to accommodate and adapt in certain
        situations.
      </li>
      <li>
        4. The Client will have to take into account that in other countries
        standards and customs are used which are strange or (less) known to the
        Dutch.

        2. Any right of action expires one year after the trip or, if it did not
        take place, one year after the original starting date.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Modification of conditions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
